Great to meet you – thank you again for participating in this research with us. My name \nis Sara, how are you today?  \n \nRespondent [R]: Hey thanks for having me along – I’ve never participated in an interview like this – looking \nforward to it.  \n \n[I]: That’s great to hear – thanks for your enthusiasm! Let’s get started - would you mind telling me a bit \nabout yourself?  \n \n[R]: So I currently work at a local web-design business. I’ve always been really creative, and studied visual arts \nat university. I feel really lucky that I’ve been able to apply my passion to my profession – we work with some \ngreat clients to bring their brand and story to life online which I love! Outside of work I enjoy going to the \nbeach – living in Bali there are plenty of beautiful spots around to go swimming – I often bring along my sketch \nbook as well. I sell my drawings in one of the local tourist shops which is a bit of fun – I’ve been doing this since \nI was 18 as it was a great way to get some money through university – I didn’t want to stop even when I got my \nfull-time job.  \n \n[I]: Bali is so beautiful – what a cool career! And that’s a great introduction, thank you. And do you mind \ntelling me a bit about your current banking needs and some of the challenges you’ve found when it comes \nto money management?  \n \n[R]: Yeah sure thing – so at the moment I suppose my main needs are just day-to-day expenses, selling my \nartwork and trying to build some savings. I’m really bad at saving… my mother always teases me… if spending \nmy monthly salary were an Olympic Sport I would win a gold medal! Anyway… so I suppose I need a banking \napp that clearly tells me the breakdown of where my money is being spent so I can see where I am being too \nextravagant and need to slow down.  \n \nWhat I find challenging about my banking experiences is understanding all the technical jargon – like I don’t \nreally know what half of the terms mean, but I know that I should start to learn them if I ever want to buy a \nhouse. So, I suppose I need a bank who can be clear in their communication, and who can tell me the best \ndeals and how different banking services work. \n \n[I]: That’s really useful, thank you! And can you tell me a bit about your current bank and your current \naccounts – why did you choose your current bank?  \n \n[R]: I use Hiya Bank for my day-to-day transactions – my best friend actually recommended them to me – she \nsaid they were really easy to set up an account with and had low fees which is always important. But then I \nactually set up an account with another bank who had a good long-term savings interest rate – so when my \nsalary and money from my art comes in, I try to send 30% of that to my savings account with my other bank, \nand then keep 70% with Hiya Bank to spend throughout the month. In this way it kind of forces me to save as \nit is tricky to transfer money in between the two – so I’m less likely to overspend if I can’t easily access my \nsavings! I know it sounds weird… but I just need help with self-discipline.  \n \nBut overall – as a web-designer, I’m really pleased with Hiya Bank as my primary bank – their interface and \ndigital approach is really slick and easy to follow, and for me that is important. I do most of my online admin \nfrom my phone, and I’ve seen some other apps from other banks which are really clunky, and that’s really off-\nputting for me. In my opinion, banks should be focussing on optimizing the mobile user experience – me and \nmy friends live on our phones! \n \n[I]: Haha, that is an interesting method to help yourself save! As web-designer you must have a great \nperspective on how an app should be designed - can you tell me a bit more about your bank’s app? What \nare the features that were really helpful and are there any features that you want that are currently \nmissing?   \n \n[R]: Yeah, being a web-designer is a blessing and curse – you can appreciate great design when you see it, but \nwhen you see bad design it’s the worst! I just want to fix things!  \n \nBut thinking about Hiya’s app – umm – what I really like is the use of graphics and charts to see really clearly \nhow money is coming in and out of my account. It then breaks down where my spend is going which is useful. \n \nIt also has a section on fees which is good to know – I really appreciate the transparency that this bank is \nproviding when it comes to their products. The colour scheme is also clean and professional – I feel like they’ve \nmade a lot of effort to make it both a visually appealing and easy experience, so I’m more inclined to use the \napp on a daily basis.   \n \nWhen thinking about improvements – I suppose like I mentioned it would be good to have a quick resource \nsection where I can learn about key banking terms. Also, as I start saving, I’ll eventually want to know what \noptions there are for investing, or home loans – particularly finding the best deals or bundles on the market. \nAnd I’d love a solution to force myself to save without having two different banks… that would be awesome!  \n \n[I]: Totally agree on the transparency and education side of things – banking isn’t something we all learn in \nschool and often have to teach ourselves! What about having a relationship with a specific person at a bank, \nor going into a branch or ATM in person – is this something that’s important to you or would impact your \nchoice of bank?  \n \n[R]: Ugh going to the ATM is the absolute worst – I try to avoid cash as much as possible! I once had to find a \nbranch to deposit a cheque and had to wait in line for hours – it was really annoying. For me it’s about \neverything being online as much as possible and having self-service help. I know that previously it was useful \nto have a relationship with your bank or a specific person at a bank, but that isn’t really a major selling point \nfor me. Maybe when I’m older and my finances are more complex, but for the foreseeable future, I’m happy to \nmanage it all by myself online.  \n \nI actually really like the instant messaging chat function that my bank now has, where you can speak to an AI \nassistant – they are often really responsive and get back to me really quickly. I actually asked the chat bot \nabout a home loan product the other day and got a reply really quickly, so that was great. I’m a classic \nmillennial who likes information instantly haha. \n \n[I]: Yeah of course, banking online is definitely making things easier - who would you trust the most when \nlooking for recommendations or information about a bank?  \n \n[R]: My friends without a doubt – of course I would do my research, but I’d ask who they were with and what \naccounts they had. It’s just so useful to hear directly from them and their experiences. Also, if I see a bank pop \nup on my Instagram with an interesting offering or a visually appealing ad then I might click on it to have a \nlook. But I’d ask around before committing to anything new.  \n \n[I]: Perfect, thanks so much. That’s all the questions I have today. Thank you again for your time and have a \ngreat day.   \n \n[R]: Thank you – hope you have a great day as well!   \n \n \nEND INTERIVEW \n","count":1},{"name":"Transcript of Interview with Young Millennial #5 \n \n---- \n \nDemographic \n \nName: [confidential]  \nAge: 27 \nGender: Female \nLocation: Jakarta  \n \n \n-----  \n \nTranscript \n \nInterviewer [I]: Hey! Great to meet you – thank you again for participating in this research with us. My name \nis Sara, how are you today?  \n \nRespondent [R]: Hi Sara, my name is [xx] – thanks for having me along – glad I could help!  \n \n[I]: Great – let’s get started. To start off with, would you mind telling me a bit about yourself?  \n \n[R]: Sure thing – so I work for a local start-up which I absolutely love. It’s a really great team and it’s really cool \nbeing part of a fast paced and dynamic team. I love rock-climbing and I go pretty much every weekend with a \ngroup of friends as it’s great to get outside after being inside working all week. I actually recently started \nmaking and selling cloth bags which perfectly fit rock-climbing shoes – it’s just a small side hustle, but it’s been \na fun project outside of work to get a bit of extra income.  \n \n[I]: Rock climbing sounds fun – I’ve always wanted to try it. That’s a great introduction, thank you. And do \nyou mind telling me a bit about your current banking needs and some of the challenges you’ve found when \nit comes to money management?  \n \n[R]: Yeah of course – because my life is just so busy, I really need all of my life admin tools to be easily \naccessible online – and that of course includes banking. I need to be able to see quickly how much is in my \naccount, how much I’m spending, if my transactions from my business are coming through correctly, and all \nthat jazz. To be honest, I’m pretty low maintenance in terms of my banking needs as I’m still quite young – so it \nis mainly just transactional and ensuring my business banking is working, but I have started to do some \ninvesting and am saving up to buy a house, so I will be doing some research on home loans soon as well.  \n \nIn terms of banking challenges – I’m conscious that there are different fees often associated with different \nbanks – and I find it difficult to see what fees I’m paying and if they are comparable across the market. I really \ndon’t want to be ripped off – but at the same time am willing to pay a small premium for a good service that is \neasy to use. Also, with the research I’ve been doing on home loans, I want to see what deals are available and \nwho is offering the best value.  \n \n[I]: That’s really useful, thank you! And can you tell me a bit about your current bank and your current \naccounts – why did choose your current bank? \n \n[R]: So, I currently bank with Yaya Bank – what I like about them is they have low fees, and a really good app. I \nwas with Jam Bank before as that’s what my parents have always used, but found the interface of their app \nreally confusing and I could never actually find or do anything that I needed to. Also, with Yaya Bank I can set \nup three separate accounts – my day-to-day transactions where my salary is deposited and I used for daily \nexpenses; then I have business account where money from my rock-climbing business goes; and finally a \nlonger term savings account which has a higher interest rate so I can earn more on the money that I save.  \n \n[I]: That’s interesting that the app was so important for you – can you tell me a bit more about that? What \nare the features that were really helpful and are there any features that you want that are currently \nmissing?   \n[R]: Hmm, let me pull out the app and take a look… *participant pulls out her phone and looks at the app* … \nokay cool – so you can see here on the bottom they have a menu with the three key areas that I want to look \nat: (1) account overview; (2) spend breakdown and budgeting; (3) profile information & fees. It is just really \nclearly laid out and easy for me to find really quickly what I’m looking for. I like the spending breakdown and \nbudgeting features as well – it has fun emojis for each of the categories, like food has a little apple, and \ntransport has a bus. I know this isn’t what everyone wants, but it makes it a more enjoyable experience.  \n \nIn terms of what it is missing – it would be cool to have a product overview section which outlines the latest \ndeals of different home loan and banking products that I might be interested in. This way all the information \nwould be in one place, and I don’t have to search far and wide for what I need. I generally have a pretty low \nlevel of understanding of what services and products banks offer – so that would be helpful.  \n \n[I]: Great, thanks – so it sounds like being able to access information digitally is really important for you. \nWhat about having a relationship with a specific person at a bank, or going into a branch or ATM in person – \nis this something that’s important to you or would impact your choice of bank?  \n \n[R]: Not really – to be honest I view my bank primarily as transactional and practical rather than a company \nthat I would emotionally become attached to. I would try to avoid having to speak with a person as much as \npossible and the idea of going to an ATM sounds like a huge hassle! It’s not that I don’t like people haha… it’s \nmore that I find it faster and more efficient to have self-service.  \n \n[I]: Totally makes sense! Who would you trust the most when looking for recommendations or information \nabout a bank?  \n \n[R]: Definitely my friends – it used to be my parents… but then I realised a lot of their information was so out \nof date and that they were so trusting of their bank they would never leave. I wanted to explore for myself and \nsee what was new and moving with the times. From my perspective, I want to grow further, I want a bank that \ncan be fast, and I appreciate upfront cost and transparency all the time.  \n \nSo to find that information I would definitely ask around in the group chat – the group chat with my close \nfriends is literally the new Google, I go there before I search anywhere else!  \n \nAnd of course – social media is where I would turn to for company reviews – like any millennial, I trust what \nmy peers are saying before I make decisions.  \n \n[I]: Perfect, thanks so much. That’s all the questions I have today. Thank you again for your time and have a \ngreat day.   \n \n[R]: Thank you – best of luck with the rest of the project!  \n \n \nEND INTERIVEW \n","count":1}]}},{"name":"_deepnote_index_column","dtype":"int64"}],"rows":[{"Text":"Transcript of Interview with Young Millennial #12  \n \n---- \n \nDemographic \n \nName: [confidential]  \nAge: 25 \nGender: Female \nLocation: Bali  \n \n \n-----  \n \nTranscript \n \nInterviewer [I]: Hey!

Great to meet you – thank you again for participating in this research with us. My name \nis Sara, how are you today?  \n \nRespondent [R]: Hey thanks for having me along – I’ve never participated in an interview like this – looking \nforward to it.  \n \n[I]: That’s great to hear – thanks for your enthusiasm! Let’s get started - would you mind telling me a bit \nabout yourself?  \n \n[R]: So I currently work at a local web-design business. I’ve always been really creative, and studied visual arts \nat university. I feel really lucky that I’ve been able to apply my passion to my profession – we work with some \ngreat clients to bring their brand and story to life online which I love! Outside of work I enjoy going to the \nbeach – living in Bali there are plenty of beautiful spots around to go swimming – I often bring along my sketch \nbook as well. I sell my drawings in one of the local tourist shops which is a bit of fun – I’ve been doing this since \nI was 18 as it was a great way to get some money through university – I didn’t want to stop even when I got my \nfull-time job.  \n \n[I]: Bali is so beautiful – what a cool career! And that’s a great introduction, thank you. And do you mind \ntelling me a bit about your current banking needs and some of the challenges you’ve found when it comes \nto money management?  \n \n[R]: Yeah sure thing – so at the moment I suppose my main needs are just day-to-day expenses, selling my \nartwork and trying to build some savings. I’m really bad at saving… my mother always teases me… if spending \nmy monthly salary were an Olympic Sport I would win a gold medal! Anyway… so I suppose I need a banking \napp that clearly tells me the breakdown of where my money is being spent so I can see where I am being too \nextravagant and need to slow down.  \n \nWhat I find challenging about my banking experiences is understanding all the technical jargon – like I don’t \nreally know what half of the terms mean, but I know that I should start to learn them if I ever want to buy a \nhouse. So, I suppose I need a bank who can be clear in their communication, and who can tell me the best \ndeals and how different banking services work. \n \n[I]: That’s really useful, thank you! And can you tell me a bit about your current bank and your current \naccounts – why did you choose your current bank?  \n \n[R]: I use Hiya Bank for my day-to-day transactions – my best friend actually recommended them to me – she \nsaid they were really easy to set up an account with and had low fees which is always important. But then I \nactually set up an account with another bank who had a good long-term savings interest rate – so when my \nsalary and money from my art comes in, I try to send 30% of that to my savings account with my other bank, \nand then keep 70% with Hiya Bank to spend throughout the month. In this way it kind of forces me to save as \nit is tricky to transfer money in between the two – so I’m less likely to overspend if I can’t easily access my \nsavings! I know it sounds weird… but I just need help with self-discipline.  \n \nBut overall – as a web-designer, I’m really pleased with Hiya Bank as my primary bank – their interface and \ndigital approach is really slick and easy to follow, and for me that is important. I do most of my online admin \nfrom my phone, and I’ve seen some other apps from other banks which are really clunky, and that’s really off-\nputting for me. In my opinion, banks should be focussing on optimizing the mobile user experience – me and \nmy friends live on our phones! \n \n[I]: Haha, that is an interesting method to help yourself save! As web-designer you must have a great \nperspective on how an app should be designed - can you tell me a bit more about your bank’s app? What \nare the features that were really helpful and are there any features that you want that are currently \nmissing?   \n \n[R]: Yeah, being a web-designer is a blessing and curse – you can appreciate great design when you see it, but \nwhen you see bad design it’s the worst! I just want to fix things!  \n \nBut thinking about Hiya’s app – umm – what I really like is the use of graphics and charts to see really clearly \nhow money is coming in and out of my account. It then breaks down where my spend is going which is useful. \n \nIt also has a section on fees which is good to know – I really appreciate the transparency that this bank is \nproviding when it comes to their products. The colour scheme is also clean and professional – I feel like they’ve \nmade a lot of effort to make it both a visually appealing and easy experience, so I’m more inclined to use the \napp on a daily basis.   \n \nWhen thinking about improvements – I suppose like I mentioned it would be good to have a quick resource \nsection where I can learn about key banking terms. Also, as I start saving, I’ll eventually want to know what \noptions there are for investing, or home loans – particularly finding the best deals or bundles on the market. \nAnd I’d love a solution to force myself to save without having two different banks… that would be awesome!  \n \n[I]: Totally agree on the transparency and education side of things – banking isn’t something we all learn in \nschool and often have to teach ourselves! What about having a relationship with a specific person at a bank, \nor going into a branch or ATM in person – is this something that’s important to you or would impact your \nchoice of bank?  \n \n[R]: Ugh going to the ATM is the absolute worst – I try to avoid cash as much as possible! I once had to find a \nbranch to deposit a cheque and had to wait in line for hours – it was really annoying. For me it’s about \neverything being online as much as possible and having self-service help. I know that previously it was useful \nto have a relationship with your bank or a specific person at a bank, but that isn’t really a major selling point \nfor me. Maybe when I’m older and my finances are more complex, but for the foreseeable future, I’m happy to \nmanage it all by myself online.  \n \nI actually really like the instant messaging chat function that my bank now has, where you can speak to an AI \nassistant – they are often really responsive and get back to me really quickly. I actually asked the chat bot \nabout a home loan product the other day and got a reply really quickly, so that was great. I’m a classic \nmillennial who likes information instantly haha. \n \n[I]: Yeah of course, banking online is definitely making things easier - who would you trust the most when \nlooking for recommendations or information about a bank?  \n \n[R]: My friends without a doubt – of course I would do my research, but I’d ask who they were with and what \naccounts they had. It’s just so useful to hear directly from them and their experiences. Also, if I see a bank pop \nup on my Instagram with an interesting offering or a visually appealing ad then I might click on it to have a \nlook. But I’d ask around before committing to anything new.  \n \n[I]: Perfect, thanks so much. That’s all the questions I have today. Thank you again for your time and have a \ngreat day.   \n \n[R]: Thank you – hope you have a great day as well!   \n \n \nEND INTERIVEW \n","count":1},{"name":"Transcript of Interview with Young Millennial #5 \n \n---- \n \nDemographic \n \nName: [confidential]  \nAge: 27 \nGender: Female \nLocation: Jakarta  \n \n \n-----  \n \nTranscript \n \nInterviewer [I]: Hey! Great to meet you – thank you again for participating in this research with us. My name \nis Sara, how are you today?  \n \nRespondent [R]: Hi Sara, my name is [xx] – thanks for having me along – glad I could help!  \n \n[I]: Great – let’s get started. To start off with, would you mind telling me a bit about yourself?  \n \n[R]: Sure thing – so I work for a local start-up which I absolutely love. It’s a really great team and it’s really cool \nbeing part of a fast paced and dynamic team. I love rock-climbing and I go pretty much every weekend with a \ngroup of friends as it’s great to get outside after being inside working all week. I actually recently started \nmaking and selling cloth bags which perfectly fit rock-climbing shoes – it’s just a small side hustle, but it’s been \na fun project outside of work to get a bit of extra income.  \n \n[I]: Rock climbing sounds fun – I’ve always wanted to try it. That’s a great introduction, thank you. And do \nyou mind telling me a bit about your current banking needs and some of the challenges you’ve found when \nit comes to money management?  \n \n[R]: Yeah of course – because my life is just so busy, I really need all of my life admin tools to be easily \naccessible online – and that of course includes banking. I need to be able to see quickly how much is in my \naccount, how much I’m spending, if my transactions from my business are coming through correctly, and all \nthat jazz. To be honest, I’m pretty low maintenance in terms of my banking needs as I’m still quite young – so it \nis mainly just transactional and ensuring my business banking is working, but I have started to do some \ninvesting and am saving up to buy a house, so I will be doing some research on home loans soon as well.  \n \nIn terms of banking challenges – I’m conscious that there are different fees often associated with different \nbanks – and I find it difficult to see what fees I’m paying and if they are comparable across the market. I really \ndon’t want to be ripped off – but at the same time am willing to pay a small premium for a good service that is \neasy to use. Also, with the research I’ve been doing on home loans, I want to see what deals are available and \nwho is offering the best value.  \n \n[I]: That’s really useful, thank you! And can you tell me a bit about your current bank and your current \naccounts – why did choose your current bank? \n \n[R]: So, I currently bank with Yaya Bank – what I like about them is they have low fees, and a really good app. I \nwas with Jam Bank before as that’s what my parents have always used, but found the interface of their app \nreally confusing and I could never actually find or do anything that I needed to. Also, with Yaya Bank I can set \nup three separate accounts – my day-to-day transactions where my salary is deposited and I used for daily \nexpenses; then I have business account where money from my rock-climbing business goes; and finally a \nlonger term savings account which has a higher interest rate so I can earn more on the money that I save.  \n \n[I]: That’s interesting that the app was so important for you – can you tell me a bit more about that? What \nare the features that were really helpful and are there any features that you want that are currently \nmissing?   \n[R]: Hmm, let me pull out the app and take a look… *participant pulls out her phone and looks at the app* … \nokay cool – so you can see here on the bottom they have a menu with the three key areas that I want to look \nat: (1) account overview; (2) spend breakdown and budgeting; (3) profile information & fees. It is just really \nclearly laid out and easy for me to find really quickly what I’m looking for. I like the spending breakdown and \nbudgeting features as well – it has fun emojis for each of the categories, like food has a little apple, and \ntransport has a bus. I know this isn’t what everyone wants, but it makes it a more enjoyable experience.  \n \nIn terms of what it is missing – it would be cool to have a product overview section which outlines the latest \ndeals of different home loan and banking products that I might be interested in. This way all the information \nwould be in one place, and I don’t have to search far and wide for what I need. I generally have a pretty low \nlevel of understanding of what services and products banks offer – so that would be helpful.  \n \n[I]: Great, thanks – so it sounds like being able to access information digitally is really important for you. \nWhat about having a relationship with a specific person at a bank, or going into a branch or ATM in person – \nis this something that’s important to you or would impact your choice of bank?  \n \n[R]: Not really – to be honest I view my bank primarily as transactional and practical rather than a company \nthat I would emotionally become attached to. I would try to avoid having to speak with a person as much as \npossible and the idea of going to an ATM sounds like a huge hassle! It’s not that I don’t like people haha… it’s \nmore that I find it faster and more efficient to have self-service.  \n \n[I]: Totally makes sense! Who would you trust the most when looking for recommendations or information \nabout a bank?  \n \n[R]: Definitely my friends – it used to be my parents… but then I realised a lot of their information was so out \nof date and that they were so trusting of their bank they would never leave. I wanted to explore for myself and \nsee what was new and moving with the times. From my perspective, I want to grow further, I want a bank that \ncan be fast, and I appreciate upfront cost and transparency all the time.  \n \nSo to find that information I would definitely ask around in the group chat – the group chat with my close \nfriends is literally the new Google, I go there before I search anywhere else!  \n \nAnd of course – social media is where I would turn to for company reviews – like any millennial, I trust what \nmy peers are saying before I make decisions.  \n \n[I]: Perfect, thanks so much. That’s all the questions I have today. Thank you again for your time and have a \ngreat day.   \n \n[R]: Thank you – best of luck with the rest of the project!  \n \n \nEND INTERIVEW \n","count":1}]}},{"name":"Polarity","dtype":"float64","stats":{"unique_count":2,"nan_count":0,"min":"0.22964413037942444","max":"0.23067541355584834","histogram":[{"bin_start":0.22964413037942444,"bin_end":0.22974725869706683,"count":1},{"bin_start":0.22974725869706683,"bin_end":0.22985038701470922,"count":0},{"bin_start":0.22985038701470922,"bin_end":0.22995351533235162,"count":0},{"bin_start":0.22995351533235162,"bin_end":0.230056643649994,"count":0},{"bin_start":0.230056643649994,"bin_end":0.23015977196763637,"count":0},{"bin_start":0.23015977196763637,"bin_end":0.23026290028527877,"count":0},{"bin_start":0.23026290028527877,"bin_end":0.23036602860292116,"count":0},{"bin_start":0.23036602860292116,"bin_end":0.23046915692056355,"count":0},{"bin_start":0.23046915692056355,"bin_end":0.23057228523820594,"count":0},{"bin_start":0.23057228523820594,"bin_end":0.23067541355584834,"count":1}]}},{"name":"Subjectivity","dtype":"float64","stats":{"unique_count":2,"nan_count":0,"min":"0.47922979797979814","max":"0.506355572532043","histogram":[{"bin_start":0.47922979797979814,"bin_end":0.4819423754350226,"count":1},{"bin_start":0.4819423754350226,"bin_end":0.4846549528902471,"count":0},{"bin_start":0.4846549528902471,"bin_end":0.4873675303454716,"count":0},{"bin_start":0.4873675303454716,"bin_end":0.4900801078006961,"count":0},{"bin_start":0.4900801078006961,"bin_end":0.49279268525592057,"count":0},{"bin_start":0.49279268525592057,"bin_end":0.49550526271114503,"count":0},{"bin_start":0.49550526271114503,"bin_end":0.49821784016636955,"count":0},{"bin_start":0.49821784016636955,"bin_end":0.5009304176215941,"count":0},{"bin_start":0.5009304176215941,"bin_end":0.5036429950768185,"count":0},{"bin_start":0.5036429950768185,"bin_end":0.506355572532043,"count":1}]}},{"name":"_deepnote_index_column","dtype":"int64"}],"rows":[{"Text":"Transcript of Interview with Young Millennial #12  \n \n---- \n \nDemographic \n \nName: [confidential]  \nAge: 25 \nGender: Female \nLocation: Bali  \n \n \n-----  \n \nTranscript \n \nInterviewer [I]: Hey!
