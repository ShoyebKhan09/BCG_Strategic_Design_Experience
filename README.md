# BCG_Strategic_Design_Experience
The main idea for this project is to leverage the data analysis methods to improve the overall UX of an app designed for millennials.

Problem Statement : BCG has recently been engaged by an Indonesian Bank to look at the current customer experience of everyday personal banking. 
Thereâ€™s a strong belief that the young millennials will very soon form the largest segment for the client, and they want to be ready for it.
