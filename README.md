# BCG_Strategic_Design_Experience
The main idea for this project is to leverage the data analysis methods to improve the overall UX of an app designed for millennials.

Problem Statement : BCG has recently been engaged by an Indonesian Bank to look at the current customer experience of everyday personal banking. 
There’s a strong belief that the young millennials will very soon form the largest segment for the client, and they want to be ready for it. 

Topic Modelling Results : 

The topic modeling on the extracted PDF text data identified key themes or topics, with a focus on banking experiences. 
The top words in each topic suggest discussions around banking, account management, and personal sentiments towards banking services. 
Here are the key themes identified:

1. **General Banking Experiences**: Words like "bank", "account", "banking", "I’m", and "like" suggest general discussions around banking experiences.
2. **Preferences and Desires in Banking**: This topic includes words such as "bank", "like", "want", "banking", and "I’m", indicating conversations about what individuals want or like in their banking experiences.
3. **Positive Banking Experiences**: Words such as "bank", "great", "banking", "day", and "money" suggest positive experiences or sentiments related to banking.
4. **Similar to Topic 3 but with App or Web services**, indicating a possible overlap in discussions about positive banking experiences.
5. **Satisfaction with Banking Services**: This topic includes words like "bank", "great", "like", "I’m", and "banking", which may reflect satisfaction with banking services and the aspects that are appreciated.

These themes suggest that the discussions in the PDFs revolve around banking experiences, with a focus on personal sentiments, preferences, and positive experiences related to banking services.
